Agreement<br/>By using the Website you agree to be bound by these Terms and authorise us to transmit information (included updated information) to obtain information from third parties, including but not limited to, your debit or credit card numbers or credit reports to authenticate your identity, to validate your credit card, to obtain an initial credit card authorisation and to authorise individual purchase transactions.</p>
                                <p>2. Amendments<br/>We reserve the right to:</p>
                                <p>update these Terms from time to time and any changes will be notified to you via a suitable announcement on the Website. It is your responsibility to check for such changes. The changes will apply to the use of the Website after we have given such announcement. If you do not wish to accept the new Terms you should not continue to use the Website. If you continue to use the Website after the date on which the change comes into effect, your use of the Website indicates your agreement to be bound by the new Terms;</p>
                                <p>modify or withdraw, temporarily or permanently, this Website and the material contained within (or any part) without notice to you and you confirm that we shall not be liable to you for any modification to or withdrawal of the Website or its contents; and</p>
                                <p>disable any user identification code or password we have provided to you, whether chosen by you or allocated by us, at any time, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms.</p>
                                <p>3. Registration<br/>By using this Website, you warrant that:</p>
                                <p>you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts;</p>
                                <p>you are at least 18 years of age;</p>
                                <p>the personal information which you are required to provide when you register is true, accurate, current and complete in all respects; and you are not impersonating any other person or entity.</p>
                                <p>You will notify us immediately of any changes to the personal information by e- mailing our customer service representatives at:<br/><br/>4. Privacy Policy<br/>We will treat all your personal information as confidential and will only use it in accordance with our Privacy Policy. In addition, we will process information about you in accordance with our Privacy Policy. By using our Website, you consent to such processing and you warrant that all data provided by you is accurate.</p>
                                <p>When you shop on this Website, we will ask you to input personal details in order for us to identify you, such as your name, e-mail address, billing address, delivery address, credit card or other payment information. We confirm that this information will be held by us in accordance with the registration we have with the Data Commissioner's office.</p>
                                <p>5. Protecting Your Security<br/>To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third-party databases.</p>
                                <p>We take the risk of internet fraud very seriously. With the volume of fraudulent credit card transactions increasing, we make every effort to ensure all orders are thoroughly checked using the information already supplied. There is a possibility we may contact you to make additional security checks and we ask for your co-operation to enable us to complete them. We will not tolerate fraudulent transactions and such transactions will be reported to the relevant authorities.</p>
                                <p>By accepting these Terms you consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected. All information provided by you will be treated securely and strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
                                <p>6. Compliance<br/>The Website may only be used for lawful purposes and in a lawful manner. You agree to comply with all applicable laws, statutes and regulations regarding the Website and its use. You agree not to:</p>
                                <p>upload or transmit through the Website any computer viruses, Trojans, worms, logic bombs or anything else designed to interfere with, interrupt or disrupt the normal operating procedures of a computer;</p>
                                <p>upload or transmit through the Website any material which is defamatory, offensive or of an obscene character; and</p>
                                <p>attempt to gain unauthorised access to our site, the server on which our site is stored or any server, computer or database connected to our site. You must not attack our site via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of service attack.</p>
                                <p>By breaching this provision, you would commit a criminal offence under the Computer Misuse Act 1990. We will report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities and we will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing your identity to them. In the event of such a breach, your right to use our Website will cease immediately.<br/>We will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by a distributed denial-of- service attack, viruses or other technologically harmful material that may infect your computer equipment, computer programs, data or other proprietary material due to your use of our Website or to your downloading of any material posted on it, or on any website linked to it.<br/>7. Third Party Links<br/>As a convenience to our customers, the Website may include links to other websites or material which is beyond our control. For your information, we are not responsible for such websites or material nor do we review or endorse them.</p>
                                <p>We will not be liable for the privacy practices or content of such websites nor for any damage, loss or offence caused or alleged to be caused in connection with, the use of or reliance on any such advertising, content, products, materials or services available on such external websites or resources.</p>
                                <p>8. Orders<br/>All orders are subject to acceptance and availability. If the goods ordered are not available, you will be notified by e-mail (or by other means if no e-mail address has been provided) and you will have the option either to wait until the item is available from stock or to cancel your order.</p>
                                <p>Any orders placed by you will be treated as an offer to purchase the goods or services from us and we have the right to reject such offers at any time. You acknowledge that any automated acknowledgement of your order which you may receive from us shall not amount to our acceptance of your offer to purchase goods or services advertised on the Website. The conclusion of a contract between you and us will take place when we (i) debit your credit, debit card or PayPal account or (ii) dispatch the goods to you or commence the services, whichever is the later, at which time we shall send you an e-mail confirming that the contract has been concluded ('Dispatch Confirmation'). The contract will relate only to those goods or services whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Dispatch Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other goods or services which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such goods or services has been confirmed in a separate Dispatch Confirmation.</p>
                                <p>We will take all reasonable care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and payment secure, but in the absence of negligence on our part we cannot be liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorised access to any data provided by you when accessing or ordering from the Website.</p>
                                <p>The products sold on the Website are not for re-sale or distribution. We reserve the right to cancel orders and/or suspend accounts where we believe products are being ordered in breach of this provision.</p>
                                <p>You will assume the risk for the products once they have been delivered to the delivery address which you specified when ordering the products. We accept no liability where you provide an incorrect delivery address or where you fail to collect the products from the delivery address which you specified. Notwithstanding that risk of loss or damage to the products only passes to you once they have been delivered to the delivery address, ownership of the products shall pass to you on the later of: (a) the products being dispatched by us; and (b) us receiving payment in respect of the same.</p>
                                <p>9. Cancellation Rights<br/>Where you have purchased the goods or services as a consumer (i.e. for private use as opposed to business use), please note that you are entitled to cancel any contract completed with us within 14 days from the day on which you acquire physical possession of the goods.</p>
                                <p>If you wish to cancel a contract pursuant to this clause, then please see our Returns Policy for further details of how.</p>
                                <p>10. Price and Payment<br/>All prices shown on the Website are inclusive of VAT (where applicable) at the current rates and are correct at the time of entering the information onto the system. We reserve the right, however, to change prices at any time without notice to you (save that any changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have sent you a Dispatch Confirmation).</p>
                                <p>Payment can be made by any major credit or debit card or via your PayPal account. Payment will be debited and cleared from your account before the dispatch of your good or provision of the service to you.</p>
                                <p>In the unlikely event that the price shown on the checkout page is wrong, and we discover this before accepting your order in accordance with clause 9, we are not required to sell the goods to you at the price shown. We always try and ensure that the prices of goods shown on our Website are accurate, but occasionally genuine errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of the goods that you have ordered we will let you know as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If you cancel your order and you have already paid for the goods (but they have not yet been dispatched), then you will receive a full refund.</p>
                                <p>You confirm that the credit, debit card or PayPal account that is being used is yours. All credit/debit cardholders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses to or does not, for any reason, authorise payment to us we will not be liable to you for any delay or non-delivery.</p>
                                <p>If your credit or debit card payment is not processed successfully for any reason, we reserve the right to reattempt to process payment within 48 hours. In the event that the payment is still unsuccessful, we will give you at least 48 hours&rsquo; notice in advance of any further reattempt to process payment by sending an email to the email address you have provided to us. If you do not want us to reattempt to process payment, you must cancel your order in advance.</p>
                                <p>We allow you to use discount codes strictly on the terms and conditions upon which they were issued which, amongst other things, may include terms relating to your eligibility to use them and a maximum order value. Please familiarise yourself with these terms and conditions before you place an order as we reserve the right to reject or cancel any orders which do not comply with these terms even if your credit or debit card has been charged. If there is any inconsistency between the terms and conditions upon which the discount codes were issued and these terms and conditions, the discount code terms and conditions prevail. A copy of the discount code terms and conditions can be obtained by emailing our customer service representatives at:</p>

                                <p>19. Referral Scheme<br/>Subject to the terms set out below, you may earn &lsquo;credit&rsquo; for use on this Website by referring a new customer(s) to us through our referral scheme by sharing the referral link and/or referral code we provide to you (the &ldquo;Referral Scheme&rdquo;). You are only eligible to participate as a &lsquo;referrer&rsquo; in this Referral Scheme if you have previously placed an order on the Website.</p>
                                <p>A new customer is a natural person who has not previously placed an order with us (a "Referee"). If the Referee has an account on the Website but has not previously placed an order on the Website then they are entitled to participate in the Referral Scheme through the &lsquo;referral link&rsquo; only. If the Referee already has an account on the Website then they will be unable to participate in the Referral Scheme using a &lsquo;referral code&rsquo; (regardless of whether they have previously placed an order).</p>
                                <p>If the Referee has clicked through your referral link the discount code will automatically be applied at checkout. If the Referee is using a referral code, the Referee must enter this code at checkout.</p>
                                <p>For the avoidance of doubt, any credit generated from the Referral Scheme may only be spent on the Website and neither you nor the Referee is entitled to receive any payment of any kind in respect of the credit. The credit is not redeemable for cash. The credit that stands to your Referral Scheme account is not transferable in any way.</p>
                                <p>You will receive the applicable credit on your account 24 hours after despatch of the Referee's order. If the Referee cancels their order for any reason within 3 days of it being despatched, you will not qualify for any credit. You will receive your credit in the default currency of the Website.</p>
                                <p>Any credit that has not been used within 90 days from the date of accrual will expire.</p>
                                <p>The Referee must place an order with a value of at least the minimum value as stated on the Website from time to time.</p>
                                <p>All discounted products and subscription products are excluded from the Referral Scheme. If you are participating in the Referral Scheme, you will be unable to participate in any affiliate schemes, cash-back offers and/or any other promotions of this nature.</p>
                                <p>We may, in our sole discretion, withdraw your credit generated from the Referral Scheme at any time if we believe or suspect that your use of the Referral Scheme is fraudulent, misleading or contrary to these term.</p>
                                <p>20. Site Offers<br/>Maximum Discount<br/>Maximum discount will be &pound;500 per order if not otherwise stated. Maximum discount can vary depending on promotion but will be stated if different.</p>
                                <p>Site/Selected Item Discounts<br/>Discount applied at basket, excluding free gifts and other promotional items. Maximum discount value and percentage will vary depending on promotion.</p>
                                <p>Tiered Discounts<br/>Discount given when offer requirements are met. Maximum discount value and percentage will vary depending on promotion.</p>
                                <p>Declining Discounts<br/>Discount percentage decreases periodically over time, as stated. Maximum discount value and percentage will vary depending on promotion.</p>
                                <p>Was/Now Pricing<br/>Discount automatically applied to products as shown on product pages. In some instances, Was/Now pricing may stack with an offer code, however this is dependent on promotion.</p>
                                <p>Free Gifts<br/>Gift(s) automatically added to basket when offer requirements are met. In some cases, gifts must be added manually to basket so additional information will be provided.</p>
                                <p>Free Delivery<br/>Applied at checkout, discount will equal specific country delivery costs. Shipping to other countries may still incur a charge.</p>
                                <p>Multi-Buy<br/>Discount applies to the cheapest in-basket item that meets the promotional requirements.</p>
                                <p>Exceptions<br/>Gift vouchers, and other specifically stated items are exempt from discount. We reserve the right to amend the list of exempt products at any time. Only one discount code can be applied per basket.</p>
                                <p>21. Subscription Plans<br/>You may choose to subscribe to a subscription plan through the Service. The subscription plan to our Service consists of an initial charge followed by recurring periodic charges as agreed to by you. By entering into a subscription plan, you acknowledge that your subscription has an initial and recurring payment feature and that you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.<br/>We will submit periodic charges (everymonth,2 months,3 months or 4 months, as selected by you) without further authorization from you, until you opt out of auto-renewal on your &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; page by using the &ldquo;Cancel Subscription&rdquo; button.</p>
                                <p>The initial payment for your subscription order will be taken at the time of checkout. Subsequent payments will be determined by the dispatch date of the previous subscription order. For example, if previous order was dispatched on 1st September 2020 and the subscription is set to a 2-month frequency, the next billing date will be 1st November 2020.</p>
                                <p>You can cancel your subscription at any time by raising a request via your &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; page. Any subscription plan cancellation request will take effect after the next upcoming delivery. For example, if you raise a cancellation on 15th September and your next delivery is expected on 17th September you will receive your final delivery on 17th September and your subscription will be cancelled from that point in time. Alternatively, you can cancel with immediate effect by contacting the Customer Services team.</p>
                                <p>All orders are subject to availability. If your subscription order is not available, you will be notified by e-mail (or by other means if no e-mail address has been provided) and you will have the option either to wait until the item is available from stock or to cancel your order.</p>
                                <p>You have the option to delay your subscription order by a month, provided notice is given at least 5 days before your next billing date. Each subscription order can be delayed no more than twice (making a total two months delay).</p>
                                <p>Discounts may be available by subscribing. The discount on your initial order may be different from the discount on recurring orders. Special offers will not apply on top of any subscription discount, except where it is relates to meeting a spend threshold.</p>
                                <p>The delivery options which you select for your first subscription order will apply for all subsequent subscription orders. Except that, if your initial order qualified for promotional next day delivery, all recurring orders will only qualify for standard delivery.</p>
                                <p>We reserve the right at our absolute discretion not to renew your subscription at any time without giving any reasons for our decision.</p>
